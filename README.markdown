JSourcePad
==========

JSourcePad is an attempt to recreate most of TextMate functionality in a
cross-platform Java application. It tries to create near native user
experience on Linux, Mac and Windows. 

Status
------

Most of the major TextMate functionality is there:

* Basic text editing
* Commands
* Snippets
* Templates
* Syntax highlighting
* Bundle installer

Lots of functionality is still missing, such as Macrosm, Completion and bundles
using dialogs. However, the main thing remaining is testing of bundles.

All in all JSourcePad is still unstable and needs lots of testing and
polish.
